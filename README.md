# 🌿 Plant Classification Web App
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that uses a deep learning model to classify plants based on uploaded images. The application provides an easy-to-use interface with two side-by-side sections: one for image upload and another to display the prediction result.

# 🚀 Features
Image Upload: Upload an image of a plant to identify its class.
Real-Time Prediction: The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify the plant type.
Intuitive UI: Clean and professional layout with two boxes—left for uploading the image and right for showing the results.
Streamlit Integration: Runs seamlessly in a web browser.
TensorFlow Support: Uses a .h5 or .keras TensorFlow model for predictions.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
